## Exercise 6
This is an assist for the TA giving feedback on this assignment.

Find in `Absyn.fs` the abstract syntax types, we have added the inc/dec operators (`++i, --i`)
and the `switch` statement. Alterations to `CLex.fsl` (tokens and keywords added) and `CPar.fsy`
(parsing of the functionalities listed above) are included.

Furthermore we have altered the `Comp.fs` file, but not the `Interp.fs` file.

We have put our answers to the examples in the `exX.out.symb` files.

There are three additional examples written by us to test the functionalities implemented,
they can be found in `exercise8-3_incdectest.c`, `exercise8-5_ternarytest.c` and `exercise8-6_switchtest.c`.

Happy reading!
